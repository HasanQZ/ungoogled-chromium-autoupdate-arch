# ungoogled-chromium-autoupdate-arch
A simple Python script for Arch Linux to automatically update ungoogled-chromium with the latest compiled build from GitHub. This is done to avoid compiling each new release.

requires:
  1. requests (python-requests)
  2. beautifulsoup (python-beautifulsoup4)

No longer maintained as I don't use Arch Linux anymore.
